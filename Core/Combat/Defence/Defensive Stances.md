**Defensive Stances** are combat states where a character prepares to avoid, deflect, or absorb incoming [[Attacks|attacks]].  
A stance must be **declared on your turn** before being attacked.

Defensive Stances include:
- **[[Block]]** — absorbing incoming force using a **[[Weapon|weapon]] or shield**
- **[[Parry]]** — deflecting **one** incoming [[Attacks|attack]] using precise [[Weapon|weapon]] technique
- **[[Dodge]]** — avoiding [[Attacks|attacks]] through [[Movement Types|movement]] and repositioning

## Stance Priority
A character may **declare both** [[Block]] and [[Parry]] in the same [[Rounds|round]], but these stances **do not function at the same time**.
- **[[Block]] is active first**
- **[[Parry]] is optional**, and only activates when you choose to interrupt an incoming [[Attacks|attack]]
- **When you [[Parry]], [[Block]] immediately ends** (whether the [[Parry]] succeeds or fails)

> **You may [[Block]] before Parrying, but cannot [[Block]] after Parrying**

### Stance Timing Summary

| Situation                                                                        | Result                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| You declare **[[Block]]** and never [[Parry]] or [[Dodge]]                       | **[[Block]]** applies for the [[Rounds\|round]] (or until its [[Block]] Value is depleted)                   |
| You declare **[[Dodge]]** only                                                   | **[[Dodge]]** applies all [[Rounds\|round]] ([[Evasion]] bonus + reposition)                                 |
| You declare **[[Block]] + [[Parry]]**                                            | You may choose to [[Parry]] at any time. When you [[Parry]] → **[[Block]] ends immediately**                 |
| You declare **[[Block]] + [[Dodge]]**                                            | **[[Dodge]] overrides [[Block]]** when activated → [[Block]] ends when [[Dodge]] takes effect                |
| You declare **[[Dodge]] + [[Parry]]**                                            | You may choose to [[Parry]] after [[Dodge]] begins. When you [[Parry]] → **[[Dodge]] ends immediately**      |
| You [[Parry]] **before** any [[Block]] or [[Dodge]] applies                      | [[Parry]] resolves → neither [[Block]] nor [[Dodge]] activate this [[Rounds\|round]]                         |
| Your [[Parry]] fails due to **lower [[Ticks, Priority & Resolution\|Priority]]** | Priority [[Attacks\|Attack]] normally → **[[Block]] or [[Dodge]] remain active** (whichever you declared)    |
| Your [[Parry]] fails due to **failed [[Attributes\|Grace]] Test**                | You take [[Damage Types\|damage]] → **all defensive stances end** for the remainder of the [[Rounds\|round]] |
| You attempt **[[Dodge]]** while already Blocking                                 | **[[Dodge]] replaces [[Block]]** immediately                                                                 |
| You attempt **[[Parry]]** while Dodging                                          | [[Parry]] resolves, then **[[Dodge]] ends**                                                                  |
| If you are **Stunned, Tripped, or Immobilised** mid-[[Rounds\|round]]            | **All defensive stances end immediately**                                                                    |
