Combat is divided into Rounds, each representing a few seconds of simultaneous activity.  
A Round always consists of two phases:
1. **Declaration Phase**
2. **Resolution Phase**

## Declaration Phase
All combatants state their intentions for the Round — such as attacking, moving, defending, repositioning, or using abilities.  
These declarations are commitments of intent, not execution.  
Once declared, the choices remain fixed; they are not adjusted based on unfolding events unless a **Reaction** or a **reactive ability** is used during the Resolution Phase.
The number and type of [[actions]] a character may take during the Round are defined by that character's [[Actions|action]] economy.

## Resolution Phase
After all declarations are made, the Round is resolved.
[[Actions]] [[Attributes|resolve]] in order of **[[Ticks, Priority & Resolution|Priority]]**, with **higher [[Ticks, Priority & Resolution|Priority]] finishing earlier**.  
When multiple [[Actions|actions]] share the same [[Ticks, Priority & Resolution|Priority]] value, they are treated as happening simultaneously. If exact sequencing matters, the combatant with the higher [[Attributes|Grace]] resolves their part first; if still tied, the GM determines the order in whatever way best maintains clarity and fairness.
If a combatant becomes unable to act (for example: knocked unconscious, disarmed, or killed) before one of their declared [[Actions|actions]] would occur, that [[Actions|action]] simply does not happen.
[[Reactions]] may be taken during this phase if their trigger [[Conditions|conditions]] are met.

## End of the Round
Once all [[Actions|actions]] have resolved:
- Ongoing effects progress (bleeding, burning, stance duration, etc.)
- [[Conditions]] are updated
- The next Round begins with a new Declaration Phase

Position, [[Facing|facing]], distance, stances, and environmental states **carry over**; combat does not reset between Rounds.
